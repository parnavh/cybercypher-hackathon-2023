        "text": "For years, it seemed as though nothing could stop Amazon’s explosive growth and success. Even a pandemic couldn’t slow it down: In fact, in early 2021, the tech and retail giant reported its largest quarterly profit ever.\n\nBut a lot can change in just two years: Since then, founder Jeff Bezos stepped down and named a new CEO, the online shopping boom slowed, and Amazon had to dig itself out of a costly and overly aggressive warehouse and staffing expansion. The past two months have been a strange, even frightening, time inside the company, current and former employees told Recode: Amazon announced unprecedented layoffs of more than 18,000 corporate employees and began culling areas of the business, like its Alexa voice assistant division, that Bezos had long championed.\n\nAs Amazon faces one of the most crucial crossroads in its nearly 29-year history, it’s dogged by a pressing question: Are the recent layoffs and cost cuts simply the sign of a company entering a new, unavoidable phase of maturity, or are they a warning flare that Amazon has plateaued and will soon start experiencing an eventual and irreversible decline?\n\n“That’s what we are all asking ourselves,” a former Amazon marketing leader, who left the company in 2021, told Recode.\n\nOnly adding to the uncertainty are open questions about whether current Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Bezos’s hand-picked successor, can lead the company through these trials without abandoning an internal culture that led to breakthrough innovations like Amazon Prime and Amazon Web Services that helped make the company successful in the first place.\n\nThe stakes of Amazon’s battle for its future are high — and it’s fighting at least partly against itself. The eventual answers to these questions matter not only to the millions of people across the globe who work for Amazon and its many partners in varied industries, but also to the hundreds of millions who rely every day on the company’s shopping, delivery, entertainment, and cloud computing services\n\nAre you a current or former Amazon employee with thoughts or tips on this topic? Please email Jason Del Rey at jason@recode.net or jasondelrey@protonmail.com. His phone number and Signal number are available upon request by email.\n\nAndy Jassy, Chief Cost-Cutter\n\nFor Amazon and its employees, 2022 served as a harsh wake-up call. And in 2023, the company and its employees will need to adapt to this new reality.\n\nEven before Amazon’s stock began falling in April 2022 when the company revealed it had overexpanded and overstaffed its retail warehouse network, Jassy had started his new role as CEO in 2021 “laser-focused on profits” and with a plan to kick off in-depth profitability reviews.\n\nThe first significant cuts came to Amazon’s brick-and-mortar retail business in March 2022, when the company announced it would shut down dozens of bookstores across the US and UK, as well as a handful of stores called 4-Star that sold an array of best-selling merchandise from Amazon’s online store. The shops were not expensive to operate compared to the company’s high-tech convenience stores called Amazon Go, but they never created enough differentiation from competitor shops to justify their existence.\n\nThen came a news report in November, saying Amazon would soon lay off more than 10,000 corporate employees — a shocking number for a company that hadn’t had any corporate layoffs of more than 1,000 people since 2001. In the fall, the company also began rescinding some job offers, sometimes just a couple of weeks from would-be employees’ scheduled start dates. And at the start of 2023, Jassy clarified that employee cuts would go even deeper: More than 18,000 roles would be axed — around 5 percent of the company’s corporate staff, but by far the largest total number of job cuts in its history. To put the abruptness of these changes in context: As recently as June 2022, Amazon’s career site had listed more than 30,000 job openings — that’s not a misprint — in software development positions alone. But by mid-January, it only had fewer than 300.\n\nThe prolonged layoff cycle caused panic and low morale inside the divisions of Amazon corporate targeted in the cuts. Some workers told Recode in November that they were questioning whether they wanted to stay at the company even if they weren’t axed. They also are questioning what the future of Amazon will be: Will it learn how to innovate again and continue to delight customers, or will it slide into maintenance mode?\n\nIn the past, after all, Amazon leaders would bristle at the idea of Amazon being pigeonholed with labels such as “retailer”; to them, Amazon has always been an innovation company with inventions like the Kindle e-reader, Amazon Prime, Amazon Web Services, and Alexa as proof. But it’s been a long time since Amazon has blown the public away with a new product or service. Alexa debuted all the way back in 2014, and that division was hit with some of the deepest cuts in the fall.\n\nJassy has tried to reassure employees that innovation is still a main focus for Amazon: “We often talk about our leadership principle Invent and Simplify in the context of creating new products and features,” he wrote in a company blog post in early January. “There will continue to be plenty of this across all of the businesses we’re pursuing.”\n\nBut he also made a point to reframe the definition of innovation to include more mundane business changes: “[W]e sometimes overlook the importance of the critical invention, problem-solving, and simplification that go into figuring out what matters most to customers (and the business), adjusting where we spend our resources and time, and finding a way to do more for customers at a lower cost,” Jassy wrote.\n\nSuch a change is perfectly natural for a massive company in a transitional stage like Amazon is, according to Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia University who was previously the CEO of multiple department store chains in the US and Canada.\n\n“It’s completely unrealistic for the company to continue to invest in innovation at a breakneck pace while it rightsizes its house,” he told Recode. He also called the cost-cutting exercise “a perfectly reasonable thing to do for a company that is doing several hundred billion dollars in revenue and that has grown meteorically.”\n\nWhat happened to frugality?\n\nIndeed, Amazon’s current predicament has been startling to many because of the financial results the company was posting in recent years. Before the pandemic, in 2019, Amazon’s revenue grew more than 20 percent year over year to more than $280 billion – an impressive rate of growth for a company of that massive size. In 2020, revenue growth skyrocketed to more than 38 percent, fueled by the e-commerce boom during the early months of the pandemic. Total revenue surpassed $386 billion.\n\nWith numbers of that size, it’s easy to lose sight of the sheer absurdity of that kind of growth. Amazon added $106 billion in new revenue to its business in a single year, 2020. For comparison’s sake, the giant discount retailer Target generated just over $92 billion in revenue during that same timeframe. Amazon added an entire Target worth of business, plus a Dick’s Sporting Goods for good measure.\n\nIn 2021, as people began returning to their pre-pandemic shopping habits, Amazon’s revenue growth decelerated to 22 percent with nearly $470 billion in revenue. And in the first nine months of 2022 (Amazon reports results for the final quarter of 2022 the first week in February), year-over-year revenue growth decelerated all the way to 10 percent. To make matters worse, Amazon’s core retail business lost more than $8 billion during that time frame, compared to an $8 billion profit during the same period the previous year. Jassy decided Amazon’s layoffs and cuts had to follow.\n\nIn conversations with 10 current and former Amazon senior managers and executives, the latter of which all left in either 2021 or 2022, there was a general consensus that a greater focus on managing costs should have come sooner for Amazon, even before the challenges that Covid-19 and a turbulent economy created for the company. The current employees were granted anonymity because they are not permitted to speak to the press without Amazon’s permission, and the former company leaders requested it so they could talk candidly. In recent years, many of these sources told Recode, ideas for new products and services were not being evaluated with the same rigor and frugality that Amazon was known for. Some blamed an influx of external middle-management hires over the last five or so years, whom they say Amazon leadership didn’t work hard enough to mold. Others argued that a corporate culture sometimes criticized as soulless and too harsh had over time moved too far in the opposite direction.\n\n“I’ve seen the transition to where you had to sugarcoat feedback,” one longtime senior manager told Recode.\n\nAmazon’s launch of a live radio app called Amp was one of the more questionable new product forays. At the time the app launched in early 2022, the most recent top innovator in the live audio space, an app called Clubhouse, was already in decline. While the two apps are not identical, some employees believed Amazon should have foreseen the slowdown in the overall live audio space. Not surprisingly, Amazon reportedly laid off half of Amp’s staff in October.\n\nOther longtime execs told Recode that besides greenlighting and overfunding too many ideas, Amazon no longer pulls the plug on bad ideas as quickly and regularly as it once did.\n\n“There used to be discipline around failing fast, going back to examples like the Fire Phone,” said a former Amazon executive of more than 15 years who left the company in 2022. “Have we done the same with other devices? No. Have we built devices or experiences where we built it because it was cool tech but it didn’t really solve customer needs? Absolutely. There was less rigor and discipline around actually solving customer problems.”\n\nAnother issue, according to a different manager who left in 2022, is that Amazon had begun attempting to invent new things just for the sake of it.\n\n“We grew and expanded for so long that we were driven by the idea that we must innovate, but we didn’t always ask if customers really want that,” the former manager said. “We convinced ourselves they did, but now Jassy is asking, ‘What is the real motivation, and for whom?’”\n\nIt’s a delicate balance for Jassy and the company to maintain: Even with these criticisms, some of those who spoke to Recode worried that Jassy’s focus on cost-cutting may cause Amazon to miss out on the next breakthrough idea that could become a future pillar of the company.\n\n“You go up to leadership with a big, maybe wacky, idea, and there was just a very heavy reticence to even consider it,” the longtime exec of more than 15 years told Recode of the time following Jassy’s appointment to the CEO role in July of 2021.\n\nOn the other hand, it’s quite possible that the approach that worked for Amazon for the last 10 years may just not be the approach that will work for the next 10. If Amazon was burning more money in recent years but big ideas were still fewer and further between than a decade ago, perhaps something was bound to give.\n\nThat’s how Columbia’s Cohen sees it: “The new CEO is willfully steering the ship toward the future with a more methodical and careful approach,” he told Recode. “There is a transition here that is necessary and appropriate. Amazon can’t be all things to all and can’t chase every rainbow.”\n\nFor some, the combination of Jassy’s deep operational experience at the company coupled with greater emotional intelligence — “I think Jassy cares and gives a damn about employees more than Bezos ever did,” one former manager said — is fostering some confidence.\n\n“I’m as bullish on Amazon as I’ve ever been,” an employee of more than 10 years who works in a division not impacted by the layoffs told Recode.\n\nFor others, especially those whose departments experienced deep cuts, they worry about what a lack of accountability for the mistakes that preceded the cuts means for how Amazon will be run in the future. Even if Jassy wasn’t CEO when Amazon invested in giant warehouse and staffing expansions that would prove misguided, he’s now the one in charge of the fallout.\n\n“If our leaders will not acknowledge that they made some miscalculations, and moved away from what was core to how we operate, how does anybody have faith that we’re not going to go through this again in the future?” a senior manager of more than 10 years said.\n\nBut the reality may be that it’s still too early to tell.\n\n“The next 12 months are really when we get to see how Andy Jassy can perform as CEO,” a longtime former senior manager who left in 2022 said.",

He said the company aimed to communicate with all laid-off workers in the US, Canada and Costa Rica by the end of the day.

The latest round will mostly affect the retail division and human resources.\n\nWhile the cuts represent only about 1% of the total workforce, which includes hundreds of thousands of hourly warehouse and delivery personnel, they amount to about 6% of Amazon’s 350,000 corporate employees around the globe.\n\nAmazon shares rose about 1% to $97.14 at 11:14 a.m. in New York.\n\nThe Seattle-based company spent much of last year adjusting to a sharp slowdown in e-commerce growth as shoppers returned to pre-pandemic habits.

The company has started notifying its employees affected by its new round of firing, as a part of its plan to reduce its headcount by 18,000, the media reported.\n\nIt, however, remains unclear as to how many employees are being affected in this particular round.\n\nAt the time, there were reports that around 10,000 people would be affected, including members of its hardware and services, human resources, and retail teams.\n\nEarlier this month, Amazon confirmed the layoffs and their massive scale, saying that including the ones from last year, Wednesday's round, and potential additional cuts in 2023, they would affect 18,000 employees overall.\n\nA memo from CEO Andy Jassy posted on the company's website announced that impacted employees would be notified starting on Wednesday.\n\nJassy said in a statement that they were not done with the annual planning process as earlier mentioned, and \"I expected there would be more role reductions in early 2023\".\n\nAs Amazon announced to lay off 18,000 employees globally, including nearly 1,000 in India, reports have surfaced that some of the impacted employees broke down and were left \"crying in the office\" when they heard they have been asked to go.\n\nOn Grapevine, a community app for Indian professionals, an Amazon India employee posted sad scenes at offices, including people crying after the announcement of layoffs.\n\nAmazon earlier admitted it was consolidating \"some teams and programmes\" in its hardware and services division, and Jassy had told workers that there would be \"more role reductions as leaders continue to make adjustments\" in 2023.\n\n(With inputs from IANS)\n\nALSO READ | Techie sells home and car to join Amazon in Europe, fired\n\nALSO READ | Vodafone likely to fire hundreds of employees soon: All you need to know\n\nLatest Business News",

        "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/01/21/amazons-stock-split-the-real-reason-it-matters/",
        "text": "In most cases, stock splits don't really matter. Whether you slice your company's ownership up in 10 million shares or 100 million shares, the total market value stays the same. Each slice is just 10 times larger in one serving model than the other.\n\nSo when I see one of my favorite companies announcing and executing a stock split, I tend to shrug and move on. I have podcasts to consume and a poor guitar to abuse, after all.\n\nBut there are times when a stock split makes me sit up and take notice. Amazon (AMZN 3.81%) sparked that response in March last year, when it scheduled a 20-for-1 stock split for early June. To me, this one was actually a big deal -- but perhaps not for the reasons Amazon's management intended.\n\nStock splits are market psychology 101\n\nFar smarter investors than me have described the stock market as an exercise in mass psychology. For example, Nobel-winning economist Robert Schiller used that exact term in 2017 to describe the overheated cryptocurrency bubble that year, also extending it to similar stock market booms.\n\nAnd stock splits play into the same group mentality. A much-cited research study by Kadapakkam et. al, titled \"Stock Splits, Broker Promotion, and Decimalization,\" suggests that stockbrokers rely on the lower share prices after a stock split to inspire heavy trading by small investors. In effect: \"Everybody else is jumping on this trade, so why shouldn't I?\"\n\nThose trading volume bumps and share prices increases tend to be short lived, as investors move on to the next morsel of seemingly game-changing news. Amazon's split was no different. Share prices rose by roughly 10% in the two weeks before the split, accompanied by slightly higher trading volume. Both effects were gone five market days later. It was business as usual, with no surprises.\n\nA cosmetic change or a vote of confidence?\n\nHowever, short-term market action can be deceiving.\n\nWhen Amazon unveiled its first stock split since 1999, it was more than a cosmetic change. The shares were priced at nearly $2,800 at the time, putting them out of reach for some investors with limited budgets.\n\nIt's true that most investors can buy fractional shares nowadays, allowing one-twentieth of an Amazon share before the split to be functionally the same as a full share after the accounting move, but a handful of popular stock exchanges still don't offer it. Others may charge a fee for taking advantage of fractional shares.\n\nMoreover, most exchanges with this handy feature don't promote it much. It's up to us investors to figure out that we don't always have to splurge for a full share.\n\nSo this stock split was actually helpful to investors who don't trade fractional shares for one reason or another. Making it easier to buy and sell your stock Is a huge vote of confidence in the company's future. It's huge because Amazon's board of directors, led by founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos, had refused to lower the gates of entry into stock ownership for so long. The company split its shares three times in 1998 and 1999 amid the skyrocketing prices of the dot-com bubble, followed by a drastic plunge when that bubble popped.\n\nI understand if that experience left a bad taste in the mouth of Amazon's accounting team and leadership -- nobody likes to made ambitiously bullish bets and then run into a brick wall. On the same note, abandoning that cautious policy after two decades and change showed tons of confidence in the next few years.\n\nA long-term perspective amid economic challenges\n\nOf course, the stock market had just started to worry about rising inflation and the interest rate moves designed to combat that issue. When the actual split took place in June, the S&P 500 was down by 13.5% year to date, and Amazon's stock had dropped 25% -- including the temporary 10% boost that the split itself may have triggered.\n\nDid Amazon's leaders miss the inflation-powered signs of an upcoming bear market, maybe even a recession? Maybe so, but that doesn't change the value I see in a bullish analysis of long-term trends.\n\nThe economy runs in cycles, and you know that dance -- upswing, followed by downswing, circle back, and do-si-do. The government's efforts to control the process sometimes amplify the size of the next round, with ripple effects for years to come. The economic mess we're in now can be traced back to the early days of COVID-19 in many ways, and other issues we're still dealing with started even earlier.\n\nThe inflation crisis is just one more ripple. In the long run, everything continues to grow. The economy will get back on its feet, inspiring Amazon's customers to place more orders, which in turn will drive the stock price up again. Investing is a marathon, not a sprint, and Amazon's stock split is concrete evidence that the company is taking a long-term view even in the face of current and upcoming challenges.\n\nThat's a good and healthy management attitude, in my book.",

        "text": "Last year was one of the worst years in Amazon's (AMZN 3.81%) history, as the stock lost half of its value. It's on pace for its slowest year of revenue growth ever. The company is laying off 18,000 corporate workers and taking other cost-cutting moves, like closing dozens of warehouses and shuttering unprofitable start-up businesses like Amazon Care.\n\nLooking ahead to 2023, investors are hoping for a comeback. But will they get one? Let's see where the company's headed this year.\n\nAmazon in transition\n\n2022 was a transitional year for Amazon, and 2023 is shaping up to be one, as well. The company, now led by CEO Andy Jassy, seems to be realizing the limits to its growth.\n\nFor years, Amazon plowed money into a wide range of projects, aiming to gain market share and worry about profits later. That strategy has paid off handsomely in some instances.\n\nAmazon Web Services, its cloud infrastructure unit, has grown to be a profit machine, while other businesses, like advertising and its third-party marketplace, are also believed to be highly profitable. Amazon doesn't break those out individually.\n\nOutside of AWS, the company lost more than $8 billion through the first three quarters of 2022. This shows how overexpansion during the pandemic and a number of money-losing businesses like Alexa, which reportedly lost $10 billion in 2022, have torched its profits.\n\nWith the company now generating more than $500 billion a year in revenue, it has become much more difficult for Amazon to grow at its historical rate of 20% or more, and the company will need to focus on profitability, rather than revenue growth. It has a number of levers to pull as it aims to improve profitability, and the results of its layoffs and other cost-cutting efforts should begin to bear fruit later this year.\n\nThe market landscape\n\nWhether Amazon can beat the market this year depends not only on its performance, but also on that of the overall economy and the stock market. Amazon is a cyclical business.\n\nOn the e-commerce side, it sells mostly discretionary products in both the first-party and third-party channels, and AWS is also sensitive to business spending. CFO Brian Olsavsky noted headwinds in the recent earnings call, saying, \"With the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, we've seen an uptick in AWS customers focused on controlling costs.\" Amazon also guided to revenue growth of just 2%-8% in the fourth quarter, an unusually slow growth rate, showing it's feeling those headwinds in the consumer business, as well.\n\nThe stock's sell-off last year came not only because of the company's poor performance, but also because of rising interest rates and the market's reaction to an anticipated recession. If the economy does get a \"soft landing\" -- meaning the Federal Reserve can raise rates without sending the economy into a deep recession -- Amazon looks like a good candidate to outperform. However, if the economy spends much of the year slowing down even more, it's possible that Amazon stock could continue to slide as its performance is likely to get worse. On the other hand, it's possible that the Fed would adjust its aggressive strategy in that scenario and things might not pan out as poorly for Amazon.\n\nThe good news\n\nRegardless of the potential outcomes laid out above, one thing is certain: After falling 50% last year, Amazon stock is as cheap as it has been in several years, according to metrics like the price-to-sales ratio (P/S). The stock now trades at a P/S of just around 2. The cost-cutting measures above should also give a boost to Amazon's profit margins, and the company should continue to grow, even in a difficult economy. This may help it gain leverage, as long as it controls costs.\n\nFamed value-investor Bill Miller, whose portfolio has beaten the S&P 500 every year for 14 years in a row, recently forecast that Amazon's free cash flow would reach $60 billion in just three years as AWS continues to put up strong growth. The company is also expected to pull back on capital investment in new infrastructure, like warehouses and data centers.\n\nTaking that perspective, Amazon looks like a good bet over the long term no matter what happens this year. It's difficult to predict any stock's performance on a one-year horizon, but with its discounted valuation, competitive advantages in areas like AWS, and a tailwind from the rebound in the economy when that happens, Amazon seems likely to outperform over the next few years.",

        "text": "What happened\n\nIt was a fairly eventful Hump Day for Amazon (AMZN 3.81%), and by the end of it the company's stock price had slumped by 0.6%. On one hand, investors were cheered by news that the giant retailer is making good on its promise to save costs -- albeit in the form of job cuts. On the other, they were dismayed about news of a government agency's worker safety allegations.\n\nSo what\n\nReuters reported Wednesday morning that Amazon will enact job cuts to its workforce in the U.S., Canada, and Costa Rica by the end of the day. Citing an internal company memo to staff it had seen, the news agency added that these are part of an announced plan for the retailer to dismiss 18,000 workers in an effort to reduce costs.\n\nWhile Amazon is still wildly successful, its margins in the challenging retail space have always been thin.\n\nLately, these have come under pressure due to inflation, while consumers and businesses both fret about the potential for the economy to slow down in the coming months.\n\nNow what\n\nOn the subject of Amazon workers, Reuters also reported Wednesday that a Department of Labor division issued citations against the company over safety at some of its workplaces. The move followed inspections at three Amazon facilities in New York, Illinois, and Florida.\n\nAccording to Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), three warehouse inspections revealed that Amazon employees were at relatively high risk of sustaining lower back and other musculoskeletal injuries on the job. OSHA added that they frequently lift heavy packages in awkward postures as part of their job, a danger compounded by the long shifts they can work.",

        "text": "After a sell-off in 2022 triggered by economic declines and a looming recession ahead, this year it is crucial to invest in resilient and reliable companies that are likely to grow over the long term. Buying stocks in companies participating in high-growth markets can safeguard your investment against short-term market fluctuations.\n\nApple (AAPL 1.92%) and Amazon (AMZN 3.81%) have strong positions in some of the most lucrative markets, which should offer sustained growth for years to come. These companies will likely continue expanding over the long term despite temporary economic challenges.\n\nWhile Apple and Amazon both have promising long-term outlooks, one is unquestionably the better buy in 2023. Let's assess.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple shares have fallen 22% since last January after a year that brought the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index down 29% in the same period.\n\nDespite market declines, revenue in Apple's fiscal 2022 rose 8% year over year to $394.3 billion, with operating income increasing 9.6% to $119.4 billion. The growth was mainly thanks to the company's leading positions in consumer electronics and online services.\n\nFor instance, while competitors like Microsoft reported a slight decline in PC revenue in the third quarter of 2022, Apple's Mac segment grew 25% year over year to $11.5 billion.\n\nThe company has come under scrutiny in recent months for its reliance on China for iPhone manufacturing. Toward the end of last year, after increased COVID-19 restrictions put strains on factories, Apple stock fell 14%. But the shares have begun recovering alongside improved production.\n\nMeanwhile, its booming services business shows the company is smartly diversifying its revenue for the long term. In fiscal 2022, Apple's services revenue rose 14% year over year to $78.1 billion, double the 7% growth rate for iPhone revenue. Meanwhile, services reported a 71.7% profit margin, while the same metric for products came to 36.3%.\n\nApple's stock may have lost some steam in the last 12 months. However, its ability to continue dominating consumer product sales in an economically challenging year, along with a swiftly growing services business, proves the company is resilient and worth investing in for the long term.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAfter a year to forget that has brought Amazon shares down 38% year over year, the company entered 2023 with a bang. Its stock has risen 17% since Jan. 1 and is still climbing. The rally seems to stem from the consumer price index 0.1% decline, suggesting inflation is easing, as well as an expansion of Amazon's Buy with Prime program.\n\nBuy with Prime will allow all eligible U.S. retailers to offer Prime benefits, such as free shipping and returns on their own sites, outside of Amazon. Optimistic analysts believe the program will make the company more competitive against Shopify and allow Amazon to boost revenue by widening its net to capture sales from nearly any e-commerce site.\n\nThe potential of Buy with Prime will be music to investors' ears after the steep declines that Amazon's e-commerce business experienced last year. In Q3 2022, its e-commerce segment reported $2.87 billion in operating losses while its cloud computing business made up 100% of its operating income.\n\nWhile Amazon Web Services is consistently reporting significant quarterly growth, e-commerce sales still made up 84% of the company's total revenue in Q3 2022. As a result, Amazon desperately needs to bring its online retail business back to profitability, and Buy with Prime is a promising step in that direction.\n\nAmazon and Apple are titans of their respective markets, holding leading market shares in some of the most lucrative industries. However, when comparing their performance under last year's economic strains, Apple was the unequivocal winner, suggesting it is the more reliable investment.\n\nAlso, Amazon's stock is trading at 90 times its earnings, while Apple's price-to-earnings ratio is far more preferable at 22. Apple's stock offers more value and is the better buy in 2023.",

        "text": "Blue Harbinger Research, Big Dividends PLUS Daria Nipot\n\n2022 was an ugly year for growth stocks. And it's going to get worse for many of them (as the pandemic bubble continues to burst). In this report, we rank 100 top growth stocks based on the financial metrics we consider most important in the current market environment (i.e. how they function with higher interest rates). We have a special focus on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), comparing it to peers on these same financial metrics, but also diving into its specific business fundamentals, including competitive advantages (not just scale and Amazon Web Services, but also subscriptions like Prime and its burgeoning advertising business), risks and valuation. We conclude with our strong opinion on Amazon and investing in select growth stocks in the current market environment.\n\n100 Growth Stocks, Ranked\n\nBefore getting into the details on Amazon, here is our high-level ranking of 100 top growth stocks (see below). To be included in this table, we required at least a 10% expected growth rate for next year (many of them are much higher) and a market cap of at least $5 billion. We also limited the table to the three worst-performing market sectors of 2022: Technology, Communications and Consumer Discretionary.\n\nOne big theme behind this table is that profitable businesses (those with positive net income margins) have performed a lot better than those that are not profitable (as you can see in the table below). This has a lot to do with rapidly increased interest rates (higher rates means funding growth is more expensive, future earnings are discounted more, and economic growth is slower; not to mention issuing new shares is less attractive for businesses now that share prices are down significantly). The table is sorted alphabetically by ticker.\n\ndata as of 31-Dec-2022 (Stock Rover) data as of 31-Dec-2022 (Stock Rover)\n\n(ASML) (BABA) (CRM) (DDOG) (EPAM) (SNOW) (SHOP) (SE) (NET) (TTD) (PAYC) (PLTR) (SQ) (SPLK) (NOW) (CRWD) (ENPH) (FTNT) (MELI) (COUP)\n\nFor reference, the growth score in the table looks at the 5 year history, as well as forward estimates, for EBITDA, Sales, and EPS growth. The best companies score a 100 and the worst score a 0. We also included sector and industry growth deciles (1 is best, 10 is worst) to help make the scores more comparable. You likely recognize at least a few of your favorite growth stocks on the list.\n\nYou may have also noticed that Amazon, one of the most popular and widely recognized business names in the world, was down ~50% in 2022, but ranks well in the table.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon Business Overview:\n\nIf you don't know, Amazon divides its business into three segments (North America, International and Amazon Web Services), but that is a bit of a disservice to analysts considering essentially 100% of the profit is generated by AWS. North America and International are basically the geographical breakdown of retail sales, which generate essentially zero profit on a segment basis, but have very profitable and growing sub-areas in those segments (mainly subscriptions like Prime and the burgeoning advertising business) that will likely be growth and profit drivers in the future. Most of Amazon's revenues come from North America (~60%) and International (~27%), but virtually all profit (100%) currently comes from its third segment, AWS.\n\nCompetitive Advantages:\n\nAmazon has huge competitive advantages over its peers stemming from massive economies of scale (which enable it to deliver low cost services) and network effects, as described below.\n\n(for example, Amazon gathers all types of information about users that will help its advertising efforts).\n\nAmazon Web Services (\"AWS\"): For starters, AWS is the leading cloud services provider (ahead of Microsoft Azure (MSFT) and Google Cloud (GOOGL)), and this segment has massive long-term growth potential stemming from the ongoing digital transformation and migration to the cloud (an enormous long-term secular trend that has slowed in recent months, but is still only just beginning in terms of long-term opportunity).\n\nStatista\n\nFor some perspective, the cloud opportunity is expected to grow dramatically over the next five years (and significantly more in the years after that) as shown in this next graphic.\n\nsource: Markets and Markets\n\nAdvertising: And while AWS is the only profitable of the three main segments, advertising is a smaller, but-high-margin business that already has some scale plus significant more room to keep growing. Amazon advertising is special because it naturally has tons of eyeballs (i.e. people using Amazon's platform already) and it has access to vast proprietary data (including real time data). It is these network effect benefits (existing eyeballs, unique proprietary data, and scale), combined with significant room for continued growth, that make Advertising an important future growth diver for Amazon.\n\nAmazon Prime: Prime memberships are also special for Amazon because they help attract sticky customers and they generate high-margin recurring revenue. Amazon Prime is basically a subscription service ($139 per year) that includes fast shipping, exclusive sales, free movie streaming and free access to Amazon's 100 million song music catalog, to name just a few. What's more, Prime helps bring users into the ecosystem, and once they're in they use Amazon more than they would have and they're less likely to leave (i.e. improved customer retention).\n\nAmazon Retail: Amazon's website and retail business is the first thing that comes to mind for many people. What's important to note about this business is that it has massive revenues but very narrow profit margins. However, it's a critical piece of the ecosystem because it brings people to Prime, it creates the platform for advertising and it led to the creation of AWS (Amazon had a huge head start versus other cloud providers because it had already built out great cloud expertise in improving its own website).\n\nOverall, Amazon's impressive ecosystem and scale has created tremendous competitive advantages (as well as powerful cash flows for innovation though research and development), and will help the company continue to succeed in the years ahead.\n\nAmazon Risks:\n\nMarket Cycle: Amazon faces risks. For starters, the market was disappointed by Amazon's most recent quarterly earnings announcement (whereby the shares sold off sharply) stemming from slower growth than expected in AWS as the aftereffects of pandemic-driven social distancing (and work from home) continue to wear off). What's more, this negative trend could continue as overall economic growth has slowed and the potential for an ugly recession continues to loom. Furthermore, there are reports that Amazon is set to lay off up to 20,000 employees (a recent trend among large technology-driven companies) in the coming months; this is encouraging from a proactive cost-control standpoint, but concerning, and indicative of potentially rough roads ahead.\n\nForeign Currency: Another risk is foreign currency effects whereby earnings have recently been impacted negatively by negative translation effects. The varying degree and pace of post-pandemic monetary policy shifts and lockdown policies have contributed to a dynamic foreign currency risk environment.\n\nRegulation: Regulatory pressures are another risk for Amazon. In particular, \"big tech\" companies (including Amazon) face growing pressures over anti-competitive practices as well as data privacy issues. For example, in 2021 Amazon received a record $888 million EU fine over data violations. Regulatory pressures are a constant risk for Amazon.\n\nCloud Competition from Microsoft (which is gaining ground on AWS) and Google are also a risk. However, given the scale of the massive cloud secular trend-there is room for multiple big players to succeed, and cloud will likely be a leading profit-driver for the next decade at least.\n\nValuation:\n\nDon't be fooled by Amazon's low net profit margins (see table below). It is largely a high-sales low-net-margin retail business. And this massive revenue retail business creates massive economic moats and network effects that strengthen its other profitable high-growth operations (AWS, subscriptions, and advertising).\n\nCurrently trading at under 2 times sales (the lower end of its historical range), and with revenue expected to grow (and keep growing) at roughly double digits (based on massive long-term secular trends), Amazon is extremely attractive-despite the fact that it's growing at a slightly slower pace than most analysts had previously expected (as they over-extrapolated the short-term \"pandemic bump\"). Also important to note, Amazon spends heavily on research and development, a cost that can be reduced anytime to increase profit, but remains important for future growth.\n\nStock Rover, data as of 30-Dec-22\n\nFurthermore, the Fed's aggressive interest rate hikes this year have had a particularly negative impact of high-growth stocks (see performance in the tables above). We believe these factors help explain the share price declines, and also contribute to the attractiveness of the investment opportunity as inflation will eventually slow, the Fed's aggressively hawkish policies will moderate (hopefully sooner than later), and Amazon will keep growing rapidly for many years.\n\nConclusion\n\nGrowth stocks, including Amazon (down ~50% in 2022) have been hit particularly hard by rapidly rising interest rates. And as we wrote in our new 2023 Outlook: 10 Stocks Worth Considering:\n\nWe could be in the very early innings of a new long-term market paradigm whereby near-zero interest rates are gone for decades and so too may be the incredible leadership and performance of growth stocks.\n\nThat said, many of the high-growth pandemic darlings that have already fallen so hard, may still have further to fall as higher interest rates have pushed profitability further into the future (and maybe never).\n\nAmazon, however, is one of the select growth stock leaders that is already profitable and has the financial wherewithal to sidestep the significant capital market challenges that many (unprofitable) growth stocks will likely succumb to in the years ahead. We don't know where the market will be next week, next month or at the end of 2023, but over the long-term Amazon (and select financially-strong growth-stock leaders) will likely be trading dramatically higher.\n\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

        "text": "The Nasdaq-100 index started 2023 on a positive note with gains of more than 5% as of this writing. And there are chances that it could have a better year following a big slide in 2022 that saw the index lose a third of its value amid surging inflation that led the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Nasdaq-100 has a history of bouncing back strongly following a down year. If that's indeed going to be the case in 2023, investors might want to load up on a couple of Nasdaq stocks that sustained a big beating over the past year.\n\nShares of Amazon (AMZN 3.81%) and Airbnb (ABNB 2.20%) are down 39% in the past year. Let's look at why buying these stocks could be a solid move based on a potential Nasdaq rally.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon stock is off to a terrific start in 2023 with gains of 17%. The company could sustain this momentum in a favorable stock market thanks to a potential improvement in the e-commerce market this year.\n\nGlobal e-commerce revenue is expected to increase by 10.4% in 2023, which would be an improvement over last year's 9.7% growth. It is also worth noting that the e-commerce market reportedly had a marked slowdown in 2022.\n\nSo a favorable year-over-year comparison in 2023 should be a tailwind for Amazon's e-commerce business. The U.S. and Europe are expected to be the key hot spots for e-commerce over the next three years, clocking total revenue growth of 50% and 47%, respectively. In the U.S., e-commerce revenue is expected to grow from $908 billion last year to $1.4 trillion in 2025.\n\nWith Amazon controlling an estimated 40% of the U.S. e-commerce space, the company should witness nice growth in revenue over the coming years. Moreover, Amazon is adopting new strategies to ensure that it captures a bigger share of the pie. The company decided to expand its Buy With Prime shopping program to merchants across the U.S.\n\nThe program was earlier available by invitation only following its launch in April last year, and the general availability of it to U.S.-based retailers will give Amazon a solid opportunity to monetize its huge delivery and logistics infrastructure. Amazon claims that the Buy With Prime program can increase shopper conversion by 25% for merchants. As a result, online merchants might line up to use Amazon's program for a fee, giving the company a nice shot in the arm.\n\nThrow in other catalysts such as the booming advertising business and Amazon's dominant position in the lucrative and fast-growing cloud infrastructure market, and the company seems set to deliver a stronger performance in 2023.\n\nAnalysts are anticipating a 10% jump in Amazon's revenue this year to $562 billion, which would be an improvement over 2022's estimated growth of 8.6%. The company is also expected to post a profit of $1.62 per share as compared to a loss of $0.10 per share in 2022.\n\nWith this Nasdaq stock looking like it might have a solid year ahead, investors might want to buy it right away as it is trading at 1.9 times sales, a discount to the five-year average of 3.8.\n\n2. Airbnb\n\nAfter a terrible 2022, Airbnb stock jumped over 17% in the early days of 2023. There are a few reasons the homestay and vacation rental company could maintain this impressive start.\n\nFirst, Airbnb's performance remained robust in 2022. The company's top line is projected to increase 39% for the full year to $8.35 billion, while it is expected to post a profit of $2.58 per share as compared to a loss of $0.57 per share in 2021. The company's impressive 2022 growth can be attributed to the healthy demand for travel, driving a nice increase in Airbnb's nights and experiences booked.\n\nThe number of nights and experiences booked by Airbnb customers in the third quarter of 2022 increased an impressive 25% over the year-ago period. What's more, customers were also willing to spend more money on the platform, and the average daily rate increased 5% over the prior year to $156. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, that increase would have been 12%.\n\nThe good news for Airbnb is that travel demand is expected to remain healthy in 2023 as well. Market research firm Euromonitor International estimates that international travel could increase 40% this year.\n\nA report from Skyscanner, an online travel marketplace, says that 45% of 11,000 travelers spread across 10 countries surveyed by the firm plan to travel more this year. And 41% of the respondents intend to spend more as well.\n\nAs such, Airbnb could grow faster than analysts are expecting in 2023. Wall Street would be content with a 12% jump in revenue to $9.35 billion and a 7% increase in earnings per share at Airbnb this year, but the company has the potential for a stronger performance. That could help the stock sustain its impressive start to the year, which is why investors should consider buying it before it soars higher.",

        "text": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nQuantum computing stocks hold incredible promise for long-term investors. In terms of what the future of computing will look like, and the future performance of computers, this is a space many long-term investors continue to hone in on.\n\nRather than traditional binary-based bits, these quantum computing companies rely on qubits that can store and calculate multiple values simultaneously. This provides exponentially-greater computing power potential, compared to current systems. Hence, it’s apt for investors to look at the best quantum computing stocks right now.\n\nMany investors are eager to get ahead of the game and capitalize on the immense potential of this revolutionary technology. Fortunately, investors likely won’t have to wait long. Projections point to quantum computing becoming commercially-available sooner rather than later, with a staggering projected growth rate of 31.2% through 2029. As such, now is a great time for investors to consider the following three quantum computing stocks.\n\nIBM International Business Machines $140.41 MSFT Microsoft $235.81 AMZN Amazon $95.46\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM)\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) is one of the biggest names in quantum computing and is set to provide many groundbreaking developments in the field over the next few years. As a result, investors should consider this company as a leading investment opportunity in 2023.\n\nIBM currently boasts more than 20 of the most powerful quantum systems available. The company has partnerships with leading companies, academic institutions, and startups looking to enhance their innovative profile. Indeed, IBM stands out as one of the top players in this field, making it a leading option for potential investors seeking investment opportunities in quantum computing.\n\nIBM’s Quantum System One is a major milestone for the commercialization of quantum computing as it is the first integrated system designed for that purpose. The quantum-centric supercomputer will allow customers to scale by combining quantum communication and computation. At the same time, seamless hybrid cloud middleware will flawlessly integrate classical and quantum workflows, creating massive potential in terms of computing capacity. According to IBM, 2023 could prove to be a crucial year for quantum computing commercialization.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure products and services are truly leading the way when it comes to the company’s success. The company’s intelligent cloud revenue grew over 20% in its most recent quarter. Moreover, company sales have been growing by double-digit percentages over the past several quarters, constituting a hefty portion of overall company sales. The success of Azure is closely linked to MSFT’s quantum computing prospects.\n\nWith the release of Azure Quantum, Microsoft has positioned itself as a major player in the growing quantum computing industry. The company is providing researchers, businesses, and developers with an innovative way to access advanced computing solutions by offering a complete open quantum cloud ecosystem. Furthermore, Microsoft’s reliable infrastructure and commercialization ability have likely set the stage for massive market share expansion over the next 10 years. Azure Quantum looks to be an exciting, forward-looking product that could revolutionize the company’s cloud computing prospects.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite its tech giant status, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) hasn’t been immune to headwinds this year, taking an unanticipated 39% beating. However, for a savvy investor looking for a buying opportunity, AMZN stock could be just that.\n\nAmazon is establishing itself as a major player in the field of quantum computing. With projects like Amazon Braket, a fully-managed service providing users access to modern software and hardware tools, the company is making great strides towards strengthening its position in this fast-growing space. Amazon’s commitment to quantum computing is demonstrated by its ambitious initiatives such as the AWS Center for Quantum Networking and the Amazon Quantum Solutions Lab. These are critical components to the company’s focus on progressing towards a quantum-enabled future.\n\nThese investments demonstrate that Amazon is fully invested in pushing quantum computing forward, making this a high-profile quantum computing stock investors shouldn’t overlook right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "text": "georgeclerk\n\nChristmas has come early, as mega-cap tech bargains are plenty. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has often traded at premium valuations relative to the market, but the stock is now curiously undervalued. The e-commerce powerhouse has been dominant for quite some time, but the market seems to have given up on the long term profit potential of the business. Even as Amazon Web Services continues to grow rapidly with high operating margins, the stock price continues to struggle. Given the company’s attractive secular growth story and value proposition, AMZN is one of my higher conviction ideas in the market today.\n\nAMZN Stock Price\n\nAMZN has fallen so much that it is now trading as low as it did 4 years ago.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nI last covered AMZN in September when I rated the stock a buy on account of AWS being worth the entire market cap. The stock has since declined another 34% which has increased the margin of safety.\n\nAMZN Stock Key Metrics\n\nAMZN’s latest quarter showed a strong recovery in top-line growth, as sales grew 15% year over year (or 19% constant currency).\n\n2022 Q3 Presentation\n\nRevenues of $127 billion fell squarely between guidance of $125 billion to $130 billion. Operating income of $2.5 billion was lower than $4.9 billion in the prior year, but in the high end of guidance.\n\n2022 Q3 Presentation\n\nAs has been usual over the past few quarters, operating margins were most negatively impacted by e-commerce operations, as AMZN has struggled to pass along inflationary cost pressures to consumers. In particular, while North America revenues were up 20% YOY, operating income was once again negative.\n\n2022 Q3 Presentation\n\nThat said, management noted on the conference call that they generated over $1 billion in operations cost improvement, largely driven by improvements in their fulfillment and transportation networks. Over time, I expect margins to rebound significantly - I view the current operating losses as being representative of the company’s willingness to take market share amidst difficult conditions even if it means sustaining sacrificing on margins in the near term.\n\nAWS has firmly become the company’s bright star. Revenues grew by 27% YOY and the segment generated $5.4 billion of operating income.\n\n2022 Q3 Presentation\n\nIn this market, however, negative sentiment has shaped interpretation of the financial results. Wall Street seemed disappointed by the deceleration in growth rates as well as the forecast for “mid-20% growth” next quarter. AMZN noted that it was experiencing some volatility in growth in part due to it wanting to help reduce cost for customers amidst a difficult market environment.\n\nWhile the company generated $2.5 billion in overall operating income, free cash flow was negative due to heavy investments in capital expenditures. Management expects to spend $60 billion in CapEx for the full year, with $10 billion less in fulfillment and transportation investments than last year but offset by $10 billion more in AWS-related costs.\n\n2022 Q3 Presentation\n\nLooking ahead, AMZN expects the fourth quarter to see revenues between $140.0 billion and $148.0 billion, representing growth of between 2% and 8% YOY. The guidance incorporates approximately 460 basis points from foreign exchange rates. AMZN expects operating income to remain pressured and end up in a range between $0 and $4.0 billion, compared with $3.5 billion in the prior year. On a side note, it appears that growth has remained resilient at the top tech companies though foreign exchange has ruined some of the luster.\n\nIs AMZN Stock A Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nIt isn’t everyday that you get to say AMZN trades cheaply. Though that might not be so obvious as consensus estimates show strong earnings growth over the next decade.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nThat growth may look unbelievable, but it incorporates significant operating leverage.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nAMZN’s business lends itself to operating leverage - especially the e-commerce segment. The e-commerce segment generated $425.7 billion in revenues and lost $10 billion in operating income over the last 12 months. In contrast, the business was generating positive 3% to 4% operating margins just a few quarters back. The struggles illustrate the headwinds from both inflation as well as the company needing to flush through excess inventory. While management was not sure about when exactly margins would rebound, I am of the view that the headwinds facing profitability are more near term in nature. Assuming a bounce-back to historical margins, the e-commerce segment might generate around $12 billion in annual operating income. Then considering AMZN’s extensive and still-improving fulfillment network, I expect further margin improvements. Assuming just 2% in margin expansion, the e-commerce business might generate $21 billion in annual operating income. I find 2% to be too conservative because of the numerous paths at the company’s disposal to drive margins higher (raising seller commission fees, raising Prime membership fees, streamlining fulfillment costs, etc). I also note that advertising may be an underestimated growth driver in the e-commerce business - that segment grew by 30% in the quarter. Based on 5% to 10% projected annual growth, I can see the e-commerce business being worth at least 15x earnings, or $315 billion. I can see AWS sustaining at least 25% growth and generating a 40% net margin over the long term. At a 1.5x price to earnings growth ratio (‘PEG ratio’), AWS might be worth around 15x sales or $1.23 trillion. Adding these together, we arrive at $1.55 trillion in value, or $150 per share.\n\nWhat are key risks? The company has a neutral leverage position and wide access to capital, so liquidity should not be a serious risk. While there is the risk that e-commerce growth does not return even after lapping tough comps, I find it more likely that AMZN continues to win market share within the e-commerce segment due to its extensive fulfillment network. Perhaps the most serious risk worthy of consideration is that of regulatory intervention - there is always the risk that government agencies view AMZN as being a monopoly. AMZN may be forced to break up its business segments into separate entities, which may reduce the margin expansion potential. That might lead to value discovery as certain businesses may earn a higher multiple, but the uncertainty leading up to any such event may present a persistent overhang. Due to the lack of positive free cash flow and material share repurchases, there is reason to expect significant volatility in the stock price. As discussed with Best of Breed Growth Stocks subscribers, I view a basket of beaten-down tech stocks as the best way to take advantage of the tech crash. I continue to find AMZN to be one of my higher conviction ideas in the market today - this is one worth leaning into.",

        "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stocks-benefit-falling-inflation-163636725.html",
        "text": "The December 2022 inflation numbers are out, and the results were better than expected. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 6.5% for the month of December 2022. This was the lowest level since October 2021, and lower than the prior month's figure of 7.1%. This latest figure was also substantially lower than the 9.1% high in June 2022.\n\nThis is fantastic news for stocks, as it shows the tough interest rate stance by the Federal Reserve is working. If we zoom out, you may remember the economy was booming in 2020 and it only started to go bad as inflation rose. To combat this, the Fed began to raise interest rates sharply, which caused an economic slowdown.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Fed chairman Jerome Powell is unlikely to ease interest rates soon due to fears that higher inflation could come back, lower inflation suggests we may see a decrease in further rate hikes. I suspect at least by the end of 2023, he might begin to lower interest rates, once we know inflation is fully dealt with and close to the Fed's 3% target (the Fed has stated that 3% is the new 2% in terms of its target interest rate).\n\nThus, this article will take a look at two of my favorite stocks that I foresee as being likely to benefit from the improving inflation environment; let's dive in.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the largest e-commerce company in the U.S. - in fact, over 56% of all U.S. e-commerce sales occur on its platform. The company is also the market leader in cloud infrastructure as a service, with its rapidly growing AWS segment.\n\nFinancials and inflation\n\nAmazon is poised to benefit from lower inflation rates as its large logistics network operates with tight margins. In the third quarter of 2022, its net income was sliced in half year-over-year $4.9 billion to $2.5 billion. This was mainly driven by a 17% increase in operating expenses, which rose to a staggering $124.6 billion. Its direct fulfillment costs were $20.6 billion, which increased by 11% year-over-year. This was caused by a sharp increase in oil prices, freight costs and even labor. A positive is that lower inflation rates were driven mainly by a fall in energy inflation, which was the main source of Amazon's cost inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\n2 Stocks to Benefit From Falling Inflation\n\nThe WTI Oil index indicates oil prices were over $120 per barrel in May 2022, but this has fallen to $80 per barrel more recently, which is a positive sign. Oil is now at a similar price to 2014, but is still above its pre-pandemic level of $55 per barrel. As Amazon operates at a tremendous scale with 30,000 delivery vehicles, its margins are steeply impacted by rising oil costs.\n\n2 Stocks to Benefit From Falling Inflation\n\nAmazon has tried to outsource a portion of its most uneconomical routes through its Delivery Service Partner (DSP) program, which enables anyone to start their own Amazon delivery business. However, this program is still in its early stages and is fraught with challenges. A positive is lower oil prices should help DSP owners to generate more profits, which will increase retention and the likelihood of the program benefits.\n\nAs inflation falls, this is also likely to improve Amazons labor costs. Amazon employs over 1.4 million people. Keeping these costs reasonable is a challenge. The company has been criticized for its poor working conditions, which reportedly pressurize workers with unrealistic targets and minimal breaks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, Amazon reported revenue of $127.1 billion, which increased by 15% year-over-year. However, this figure came in below analyst estimates by $370 million. This was mainly impacted by a strong U.S. dollar, which impacted foreign exchange rates. Overall, I believe most markets tend to be cyclical, thus I expect this metric to reverse long-term. Part of the sell-off in the Euro has been driven by the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n2 Stocks to Benefit From Falling Inflation\n\nAmazons cloud business is expected to be a continued growth driver of the companys success. AWS reported sales of $20.5 billion in the third quarter, which increased by a rapid 28% year-over-year, despite a tough economic backdrop. Its operating income also rose by $5.4 billion, or 11% year-over-year.\n\nValuation\n\nAmazon trades at a price-sales ratio of 1.99, which is ~46% cheaper than its five-year average.\n\n2 Stocks to Benefit From Falling Inflation\n\nThe GF Value chart indicates a fair value of $193 per share, making the stock significantly undervalued at the time of writing.\n\n2 Stocks to Benefit From Falling Inflation\n\nInvestors such as Al Gore (Trades, Portfolio), Stanley Druckenmiller (Trades, Portfolio) and Catherine Wood (Trades, Portfolio) were buying shares of Amazon in the third quarter of 2022, during which shares traded for an average price of $126, based on their 13F reports.\n\nInvestors should be aware that 13F reports do not provide a complete picture of a gurus holdings. They include only a snapshot of long equity positions in U.S.-listed stocks and American depository receipts as of the quarters end. They do not include short positions, non-ADR international holdings or other types of securities. However, even this limited filing can provide valuable information.\n\n2. WEX Inc.\n\nWEX Inc. (NYSE:WEX) is a fintech company that offers a fleet card and virtual card program for a range of business and government clients. As inflation is falling, along with fuel prices, I imagine the companys customers will be more interested in purchasing new solutions related to fuel card programs for trucking fleets. However, as high oil prices are still at the top of the mind, I imagine these customers will be eager to optimize fuel costs.\n\n2 Stocks to Benefit From Falling Inflation\n\nFinancials and inflation\n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the company reported strong revenue of $616 million, which beat analyst estimates by $28.27 million and increased by 26% year-over-year.\n\n2 Stocks to Benefit From Falling Inflation\n\nThe company also reported strong earnings per share of $3.51, which beat analyst estimates by $0.09 on a non-GAAP basis.\n\n2 Stocks to Benefit From Falling Inflation\n\nWEX has a solid balance sheet with $2.18 billion in cash and short-term investments. The company does have fairly high total debt of ~$3 billion, but just $86 million of this is current debt and thus manageable. In the longer term, as interest rates start to be lowered, this should reduce debt servicing costs, which is a strong positive.\n\nValuation\n\nWEX trades at a non-GAAP price-earnings ratio of 13.45, which is over 39% cheaper than its five-year average. The company also trades at a price-sales ratio of 3.55, which is 26% cheaper than its five-year average.\n\n2 Stocks to Benefit From Falling Inflation\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nBoth Amazon and WEX are great companies that are poised to benefit from the falling inflation figures. Amazon is poised to benefit from lower fulfillment center costs, and WEX is expected to benefit from the desire to reduce fuel costs but it is more of a niche play. Overall, Amazon is my favorite pick for lower inflation as the company's low-margin e-commerce business is set to recover.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",
